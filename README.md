Interactive-graph
=================

This is mostly a project that I made to try out a few different
Haskell libraries (attoparsec and threepenny-gui). It takes in a
specification for a graph and displays a HTML interface using
threepenny-gui that allows you to step through the graph node by
node. It makes the most sense for flowcharts or DFAs.
